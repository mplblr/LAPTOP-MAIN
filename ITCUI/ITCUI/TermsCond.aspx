            2.2 User agrees to purchase Internet access services (&quot;Services&quot;) made

        </p>
        <p>
            2.4 Here are a few <em>security recommendations:</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Disable the wireless cards ad-hoc (peer-to-peer) mode. This can be done via the
            adapter's utilities or within Windows XP. Remove or disable the wireless card if
            you are working offline.
            <br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Install a personal firewall. Windows XP offers a basic firewall, but a more advanced
            personal firewall can prevent others from accessing a laptop. Install personal antivirus
            software.
            <br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Take advantage of the email client's security features, particularly digital signatures
            and email encryption. Digital signatures verify your identity to your recipients
            and ensure that messages are not tampered with. Make sure you submit credit-card
            information only to SSL-protected web sites (look for https:// in the address bar).
            Keep your OS and software up to date with security patches.
            <br />
            <br />
